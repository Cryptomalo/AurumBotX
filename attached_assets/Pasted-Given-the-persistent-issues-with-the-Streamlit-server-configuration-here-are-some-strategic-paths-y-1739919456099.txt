Given the persistent issues with the Streamlit server configuration, here are some strategic paths you could take:
Option 1: Continue with Bug Checking and Optimization Using Alternative Methods Without Relying on the Streamlit Interface
Pros:
Direct Problem Solving: You can focus on the core functionality of your trading system without the complications of UI configuration.
Testing: It allows for more thorough testing of logic, algorithms, and data processing without UI dependency.
Debugging: Easier to isolate bugs related to data handling, calculations, or strategy logic.
Cons:
User Experience: Without Streamlit, you might lose out on the interactive and user-friendly interface that Streamlit provides.
Visual Feedback: It could be harder to get immediate visual feedback on data or trading results.
Steps:
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual components of your system using a testing framework like pytest or unittest.
Logging: Enhance your logging to capture more detailed information about system operations.
Script Mode: Run your Python scripts directly from the command line to test functionality, using argparse for command line arguments if needed for configuration.
Option 2: Focus on Backend System Checks and Optimizations First, Then Return to the UI Setup Later
Pros:
Stability: By ensuring the backend is stable and optimized, you create a solid foundation for your application.
Performance: You can address performance issues like scalability, data processing speed, or memory management before adding the UI layer.
Easier UI Integration: A robust backend will make integrating with any UI framework smoother later on.
Cons:
Delay in UI: There might be a delay in user interaction capabilities if you postpone the UI development.
Steps:
Database Optimization: If you're using a database, ensure indexing, query optimization, and data model efficiency.
Async Programming: Further refine your use of asyncio or explore other asynchronous programming techniques for better I/O handling.
API Development: Develop or refine RESTful or WebSocket APIs for your trading functions, which can be tested independently.
Option 3: Try a Different Visualization Approach (e.g., Using a Simple Web Interface or Command-Line Tools)
Pros:
Simplification: A simpler interface might bypass the issues you're facing with Streamlit.
Flexibility: Command-line tools can be very powerful for quick checks and data analysis without graphical overhead.
Low Overhead: Simple web interfaces (like Flask or FastAPI with minimal HTML/CSS) could run with less resource consumption.
Cons:
Limited Interactivity: You might lose some of the dynamic interactivity that Streamlit provides.
Learning Curve: If you're not familiar with web development or command-line tool creation for data visualization, there might be an initial learning curve.
Steps:
Command Line: Use libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib or plotly for plotting directly in command line tools or scripts.
Simple Web Server: Use Flask or FastAPI to serve simple HTML pages with embedded plots or tables. Libraries like bokeh can provide interactive plots with minimal setup.
Static Visuals: Create static visualizations that can be refreshed manually or through a cron job for periodic updates.
Recommendation:
Given your current situation with Streamlit, I would recommend Option 2: Focus on Backend System Checks and Optimizations First. This approach will help you build a more robust system that, once stable, will be easier to integrate with any UI tool, including potentially returning to Streamlit with more knowledge about where the issues lie. After you've solidified your backend, you can decide whether to return to Streamlit or opt for another visualization method based on your new understanding of the system's requirements and performance characteristics.
